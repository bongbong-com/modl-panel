# Icon Upload and Display Functionality Test

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed Public Settings API Endpoint**
- Updated `/api/public/settings` to include `homepageIconUrl` in addition to `panelIconUrl`
- Added proper fallback values for all endpoints

### 2. **Updated Client-Side Hooks**
- Enhanced `usePublicSettings` hook to include `homepageIconUrl`
- Updated `useDocumentTitle` hook to return `homepageIconUrl`

### 3. **Updated Homepage Component**
- Modified `HomePage.tsx` to use uploaded homepage icon instead of hardcoded server logo
- Added fallback to default server logo if no homepage icon is uploaded
- Uses `publicSettings?.homepageIconUrl || serverLogo` for the homepage logo display

### 4. **Updated Sidebar Component**
- Modified `Sidebar.tsx` to use uploaded panel icon instead of hardcoded server logo
- Added fallback to default server logo if no panel icon is uploaded
- Uses `publicSettings?.panelIconUrl || serverLogo` for the sidebar logo display

### 5. **Verified Static File Serving**
- Confirmed that uploaded files are served statically from `/uploads` directory
- Upload endpoint generates URLs in format: `/uploads/{serverName}/{iconType}-icon-{timestamp}.{ext}`

## How It Works

### Icon Upload Process:
1. User uploads icon via Settings page
2. File is saved to `/uploads/{serverName}/{iconType}-icon-{timestamp}.{ext}` 
3. URL is stored in settings as `homepageIconUrl` or `panelIconUrl`
4. Settings are saved to database

### Icon Display Process:
1. Public pages (Homepage) call `/api/public/settings` to get `homepageIconUrl`
2. Protected pages (Sidebar) also use public settings for consistency
3. Components use uploaded icon URL if available, fallback to default logo
4. Browser favicon is updated using `panelIconUrl` via `useDocumentTitle` hook

## Testing

To test the functionality:

1. **Upload Homepage Icon:**
   - Go to Settings > General > Server Icons
   - Upload an image for "Homepage Icon"
   - Visit the public homepage to see the new icon

2. **Upload Panel Icon:**
   - Go to Settings > General > Server Icons  
   - Upload an image for "Panel Icon"
   - Check the sidebar logo and browser favicon

3. **Verify Static File Serving:**
   - After upload, the icon URLs should be accessible directly
   - Example: `http://localhost:5000/uploads/your-server/homepage-icon-1234567890.png`

## Key Files Modified:

### Server-side:
- `/server/routes.ts` - Updated public settings endpoint
- `/server/routes/settings-routes.ts` - Icon upload endpoint (already working)
- `/server/index.ts` - Static file serving (already configured)

### Client-side:
- `/client/src/hooks/use-public-settings.tsx` - Added homepageIconUrl
- `/client/src/hooks/use-document-title.tsx` - Added homepageIconUrl return
- `/client/src/pages/HomePage.tsx` - Use uploaded homepage icon
- `/client/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` - Use uploaded panel icon

The implementation is now complete and should work correctly when deployed remotely!
