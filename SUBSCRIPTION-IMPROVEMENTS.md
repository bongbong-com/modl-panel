# Ticket Subscription System Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Backend API Updates (`server/routes/ticket-subscription-routes.ts`)

#### Subscription Updates Endpoint (`/api/panel/ticket-subscription-updates`)
- **Only returns unread replies** - read replies are filtered out completely
- **Shows only latest unread reply per ticket** - no duplicate entries for same ticket
- **Adds "and X more" count** when there are additional unread replies in same ticket
- **Updates title format** to "TICKET-ID: subject line" format

#### Active Subscriptions Endpoint (`/api/panel/ticket-subscriptions`)
- **Updates title format** to "TICKET-ID: subject line" format

#### Key Logic Changes:
```typescript
// Filter out read replies completely
const unreadReplies = recentReplies.filter(reply => {
  const replyDate = new Date(reply.created || reply.timestamp || reply.replyAt);
  return !subscription.lastReadAt || replyDate > new Date(subscription.lastReadAt);
});

// Only show if there are unread replies
if (unreadReplies.length > 0) {
  // Show only the latest unread reply
  const latestReply = unreadReplies[0];
  const additionalCount = unreadReplies.length - 1;
  
  // Include additionalCount in response
  updatesWithDetails.push({
    // ... other fields
    ticketTitle: `${ticket._id}: ${ticket.subject || ticket.title || 'Untitled Ticket'}`,
    additionalCount: additionalCount > 0 ? additionalCount : undefined
  });
}
```

### 2. ✅ Frontend Component Updates (`client/src/components/dashboard/TicketSubscriptionsSection.tsx`)

#### Interface Updates:
```typescript
export interface TicketSubscriptionUpdate {
  // ... existing fields
  additionalCount?: number; // NEW: Shows count of additional unread replies
}
```

#### Display Improvements:
- **Title format**: Now shows "TICKET-ID: subject line" for both updates and subscriptions
- **"and X more" badge**: Shows when there are additional unread replies in the same ticket
- **Simplified read state**: Since backend only returns unread items, all items are styled as unread
- **Auto-mark as read**: Clicking any update marks it as read and removes it from the list

#### Visual Changes:
```jsx
// Shows additional count badge
{update.additionalCount && update.additionalCount > 0 && (
  <div className="mb-2">
    <Badge variant="outline" className="text-xs">
      and {update.additionalCount} more
    </Badge>
  </div>
)}

// All updates styled as unread (blue border/background)
<div className="p-3 border border-border rounded-lg hover:bg-muted/50 transition-colors cursor-pointer bg-blue-500/5 border-blue-500/20">
```

### 3. ✅ Fixed Missing Auto-Subscription (`server/routes/ticket-routes.ts`)

#### Added subscription logic to PATCH endpoint:
```typescript
// Auto-subscribe staff member to ticket when they reply
if (newReply.staff && req.session?.username) {
  console.log(`[Ticket PATCH] Auto-subscribing ${req.session.username} to ticket ${req.params.id}`);
  try {
    const { ensureTicketSubscription } = await import('./ticket-subscription-routes');
    await ensureTicketSubscription(req.serverDbConnection!, req.params.id, req.session.username);
  } catch (subscriptionError) {
    console.error(`[Ticket PATCH] Failed to handle ticket subscription for ticket ${req.params.id}:`, subscriptionError);
  }
}
```

## What Users Will See Now

### ✅ Recent Replies Section:
- **Format**: "SUPPORT-849748: Help with server setup"
- **Auto-hide**: Replies disappear after being read (clicked)
- **Consolidated**: Only latest unread reply per ticket shown
- **Additional count**: "and 2 more" badge when multiple unread replies exist
- **Visual**: Blue border/background for all unread items

### ✅ Active Subscriptions Section:
- **Format**: "SUPPORT-849748: Help with server setup"
- **Unchanged**: Still shows all active subscriptions with unsubscribe option

### ✅ Behavior:
1. **Reply to ticket** → Auto-subscribe to ticket
2. **New replies come in** → Show in "Recent Replies" 
3. **Click on update** → Mark as read + navigate to ticket
4. **Read updates** → Automatically removed from list
5. **Multiple unread in same ticket** → Show latest + "and X more" badge

## Testing

1. Debug logs showing auto-subscription
