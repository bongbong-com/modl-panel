# Custom Domain Routing Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to implement proper custom domain routing for the modl-panel application.

## Overview

The system now properly routes custom domains (like `panel.yourdomain.com`) to the correct tenant panels while maintaining backward compatibility with subdomain routing (`tenant.modl.gg`).

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`server/models/modl-global-schemas.ts`)

- Added `customDomain_cloudflareId` field to track Cloudflare hostname IDs
- This enables better tracking and management of custom hostnames

### 2. Middleware Enhancement (`server/middleware/subdomainDbMiddleware.ts`)

**Enhanced hostname detection:**
- Now properly handles both subdomain patterns (`tenant.modl.gg`) and custom domains (`panel.yourdomain.com`)
- Custom domains are treated as potential server identifiers

**Improved database lookup:**
- For subdomains: Looks up by `customDomain` field
- For custom domains: Looks up by `customDomain_override` field with `customDomain_status: 'active'`
- Only active custom domains are routed to prevent access to unverified domains

**Database connection mapping:**
- When a custom domain is found, the middleware maps it back to the original subdomain for database connection
- This ensures the correct tenant database is accessed regardless of the domain used

**Enhanced logging:**
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging routing decisions
- Logs hostname detection, database lookups, and mapping results

### 3. Background Status Monitoring (`server/api/cloudflare.ts`)

**Enhanced status updater:**
- Improved logging when domains become active
- Better error handling for missing hostnames
- Status change detection to avoid unnecessary database updates
- Automatic database updates when domain status changes in Cloudflare

**Activation detection:**
- Logs when a domain transitions from pending/verifying to active
- Provides clear feedback when custom domain routing becomes available

### 4. Domain Verification Enhancement (`server/routes/domain-routes.ts`)

**Improved verification response:**
- Added success messages for different verification states
- Enhanced logging when domains become active
- Better status tracking with Cloudflare ID storage

**Interface updates:**
- Updated `IModlServer` interface to include all necessary fields
- Added proper typing for custom domain fields

### 5. Server Startup Integration (`server/index.ts`)

**Background monitor startup:**
- Domain status updater now starts automatically with the server
- Monitors custom domains every 10 minutes
- Graceful error handling if monitor fails to start

### 6. Client-Side Improvements (`client/src/components/settings/DomainSettings.tsx`)

**Enhanced user feedback:**
- Improved toast messages based on verification status
- Better status communication for different states
- Clear messaging when domains become active

## Routing Flow

### For Subdomain Requests (`tenant.modl.gg`)
1. Extract subdomain from hostname
2. Look up server by `customDomain` field
3. Connect to tenant database using subdomain
4. Proceed with request processing

### For Custom Domain Requests (`panel.yourdomain.com`)
1. Detect non-subdomain hostname
2. Look up server by `customDomain_override` with status 'active'
3. Map custom domain back to original subdomain
4. Connect to tenant database using original subdomain
5. Proceed with request processing

## Background Monitoring

The system includes a background service that:
- Runs every 10 minutes
- Checks all non-active custom domains with Cloudflare
- Updates database status when domains become active
- Logs activation events for monitoring
- Handles errors gracefully

## Security Features

- Only active custom domains are routed
- Inactive/pending domains return 404 responses
- Proper validation of domain ownership through Cloudflare
- Database access is properly scoped to the correct tenant

## Testing

A test script is provided at `server/scripts/test-custom-domain-routing.ts` to verify:
- Database schema and connections
- Routing logic simulation
- Custom domain lookup functionality
- Status tracking

## Benefits

1. **Seamless Routing**: Custom domains work transparently with existing infrastructure
2. **Security**: Only verified domains are routed to prevent unauthorized access
3. **Monitoring**: Automatic status updates ensure reliable routing
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing subdomain routing continues to work
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
6. **User Experience**: Clear feedback during domain setup and verification

## Usage

Once a custom domain is configured and verified:
1. Users can access their panel via `https://panel.yourdomain.com`
2. The system automatically routes to the correct tenant
3. SSL certificates are managed by Cloudflare
4. Status is monitored continuously in the background

The implementation maintains full compatibility with existing features while adding robust custom domain support.
